Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal 
substring consisting of non-space characters only.
Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.
Coding:
public class Solution {
    public static int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        s = s.trim();
        int lastSpaceIndex = s.lastIndexOf(' ');
        return s.length() - lastSpaceIndex - 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "Hello World";
        System.out.println(lengthOfLastWord(s1)); 
        String s2 = "   fly me   to   the moon  ";
        System.out.println(lengthOfLastWord(s2)); 
        String s3 = "luffy is still joyboy";
        System.out.println(lengthOfLastWord(s3)); 
    }
}
Output:
Input
s =
"Hello World"
Output
5
Expected
5
